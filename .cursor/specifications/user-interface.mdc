- Game phase indicator: `Come Out Roll` or `Point Phase`
- Dice results: `You rolled a 6 and a 2 (8 total)`
- Point display: `Point is 8` (during Point Phase)
- Game status messages: `You win!`, `You lose!`, etc.

### User Inputs

- `Press Enter to roll the dice`
- `Type 'rules' to view game rules`
