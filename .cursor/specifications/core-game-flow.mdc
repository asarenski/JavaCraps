## Core Game Flow

1. Initialize game state and show player balance.
2. Prompt for and validate bet input.
3. Roll two dice and determine outcome based on Craps rules:
   - **Come Out Roll**:
     - Win if roll is 7 or 11.
     - Lose if roll is 2, 3, or 12.
     - Otherwise, set point and enter Point Phase.
   - **Point Phase**:
     - Continue rolling.
     - Win if roll matches point.
     - Lose if roll is 7.
4. Update balance and reset or end game depending on win/loss.

## Example Game Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
start
:Initialize game state;
:Display balance and ask for bet;
:Roll Dice;

if (Come Out Roll) then (true)
  if (7 or 11?) then (yes)
    :Player wins;
    -> [reset]
  elseif (2,3,12?) then (yes)
    :Player loses;
    -> [reset]
  else
    :Set point;
    :Enter Point Phase;
    repeat
      :Roll Dice;
      if (Roll == point) then (yes)
        :Player wins;
        -> [reset]
      elseif (Roll == 7) then (yes)
        :Player loses;
        -> [reset]
      endif
    repeat while (not win or lose)
  endif
endif
stop

## Game State Machine

```plantuml
@startuml
[*] --> ComeOut : Start Game

ComeOut --> Win : Roll 7 or 11
ComeOut --> Lose : Roll 2, 3, or 12
ComeOut --> PointPhase : Roll 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10
PointPhase --> Win : Roll equals point
PointPhase --> Lose : Roll 7
PointPhase --> PointPhase : Any other roll

Win --> [*] : Reset Game
Lose --> [*] : Reset Game
