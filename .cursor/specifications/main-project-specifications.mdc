# Main Project Specifications

## Overview
This project implements a terminal-based version of the classic dice game Craps using Java and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It is a learning-focused, offline simulation intended for single-player use. The goal is to win by growing the player’s balance from $100 to $1000 using correct betting and dice roll outcomes per Craps rules.

## Game Conditions
- Starting Balance: $100
- Minimum Bet: $5
- Win Condition: Reaching $1000
- Lose Condition: Reaching $0

## Game Requirements
### Must Have
- Core Craps gameplay logic including:
  * Dice rolling mechanism (two six-sided dice)
  * Game phase management (Come Out Roll and Point Phase)
  * Bet placement system with a minimum bet of $5
  * Player balance starting at $100
  * Win condition: balance reaches $1000
  * Lose condition: balance reaches $0
- MVC architecture implemented in Java
- State transitions and game outcomes based on standard Craps rules
- Interactive interface (terminal or simple GUI)
- Clear UI display for balance, current bet, and game state
- Game state management (win/loss/reset)

### Should Have
- Prevent betting more than the current balance
- Show history of previous rolls and outcomes
- Simple error handling (invalid inputs, non-numeric entries)

### Could Have
- Option to reset game

### Won’t Have
- Multiple player profiles or sessions
- Sound or animation effects for dice roll in GUI version
- Multiplayer over network
- Real-money transactions
