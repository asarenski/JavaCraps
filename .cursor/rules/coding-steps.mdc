# When asked to code a task
When you are asked to code a task from [implementation-tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/specifications/implementation-tasks.mdc)

1. Review the [main-project-specifications.mdc](mdc:.cursor/specifications/main-project-specifications.mdc) to understand requirements
2. Identify the specific task in [implementation-tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/specifications/implementation-tasks.mdc)
3. Review any related specifications (e.g., architecture, game flow, etc.)
4. Implement the code:
   - Create new files or modify existing ones
   - Add necessary tests
   - Add proper documentation
5. Ensure proper module dependencies are declared
6. Compile with `mvn clean verify`
7. Run unit tests with `mvn test`
8. Mark the task with an "x" in [implementation-tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/specifications/implementation-tasks.mdc)
9. Commit changes
10. Wait for user instruction before proceeding to next implementation task

Note: Steps 1-9 should be executed automatically in sequence. Only pause at step 10 to wait for user instruction on which implementation task to tackle next. This ensures efficient workflow while still maintaining user control over task selection.
