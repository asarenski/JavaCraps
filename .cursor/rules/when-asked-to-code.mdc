# When asked to code a task
When you are asked to code a task from [implementation-tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/specifications/implementation-tasks.mdc)

1. Review the @main-project-specifications.mdc to understand requirements
2. Identify the specific task in @implementation-tasks.mdc
3. Review any related specifications (e.g., architecture, game flow, etc.)
4. Implement the code:
   - Create new files or modify existing ones
   - Add necessary tests
   - Add proper documentation
5. Ensure proper module dependencies are declared
6. Compile with `mvn clean verify`
7. Run unit tests with `mvn test`
8. Mark the task with an "x" in @implementation-tasks.mdc
9. Commit changes
10. Wait for user instruction before proceeding to next task

Note: All steps must be completed in order. Do not skip steps or proceed to the next task until explicitly instructed by the user.
